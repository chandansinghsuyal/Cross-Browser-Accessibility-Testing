# NVDA Integration Guide

## Overview
This project aims to automate accessibility testing using Selenium WebDriver and the NVDA screen reader. While Selenium can automate browser actions, NVDA is used to validate the actual spoken output for users with visual impairments.

## Steps for NVDA Integration
1. **Install NVDA**
   - Download and install NVDA from [nvaccess.org](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/).
   - NVDA runs on Windows. For cross-platform automation, use a Windows VM or machine.

2. **Automate NVDA with Python**
   - Use the `pywinauto` library to control NVDA (start, stop, send keyboard commands).
   - Example:
     ```python
     from pywinauto.application import Application
     app = Application().start('nvda.exe')
     # Use app to send keys, read logs, etc.
     ```

3. **Validate Spoken Output**
   - NVDA can be configured to log speech output to a file.
   - After running Selenium actions, check the NVDA log for expected spoken text.

4. **Combine with Selenium**
   - Run Selenium scripts to navigate and interact with the web page.
   - Use `pywinauto` to trigger NVDA reading and capture output.

## Note
- NVDA automation is only supported on Windows. For Mac/Linux, consider using VoiceOver or Orca, respectively.
